# Mini Wordle

Mini Wordle is a Python implementation of the game 'Wordle' where the player has to guess a 5-letter word within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on the correctness of each guess.

## How to Play

- You have 10 attempts to guess the secret 5-letter word.
- For each guess, you'll receive feedback indicating which letters are correct and in the correct position (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are not in the word at all (grey).
